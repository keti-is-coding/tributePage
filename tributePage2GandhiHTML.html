        <p id="paragraph1">Mahatma Gandhi was the primary leader of India’s independence movement
          and also the architect of a form of non-violent civil disobedience that
          would influence the world. Until Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, his
          life and teachings inspired activists including
          Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.

          Born in Porbandar, India, Gandhi studied law and organized boycotts against British
